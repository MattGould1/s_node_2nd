### Guidelines

- TODO

### Notes

- TS-compiler enforces that extensions (.ts etc.) are not used with imports for
  some reason (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27481). ESLint
  has been made aware of this by configuration and using
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-typescript
